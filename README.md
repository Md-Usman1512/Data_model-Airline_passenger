Dataset Details 
Airlines regularly send surveys to their passengers in order to collect valuable feedback to improve future passengers' flying experiences. Often, these surveys focus on the specific services in which the airline provides, and are sometimes dedicated primarily to the passenger's satisfaction towards a new service, or one that is of concern to the airline in order to get a better idea of their responses to such services' conditions.
The dataset used comprises of passenger satisfaction levels of different aspects of an anonymous US airline's services, and their overall experience with the airline.


Goals And Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to understand how the circumstances in which passengers on this airline affects their overall satisfaction towards their flight. In order to do this, the goals is to explore the relationships between the types of customers and their response to certain aspects of their flight experience, and how these experiences relate to their overall trip's satisfaction.
These types of relationships can help an airline determine the aspects of their services that lack, in order to improve the passenger experience and increase their number of seat sales.
